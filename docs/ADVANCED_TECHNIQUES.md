## Chain of Thought (CoT)

Chain of Thought prompting encourages the LLM to break down complex problems into a series of intermediate steps, improving its reasoning abilities.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  chainOfThought {
    step("Understand the Problem") {
      text`First, let's clearly state what we're trying to solve.`;
    }
    step("Break Down the Problem") {
      text`Now, let's break this problem into smaller, manageable parts.`;
    }
    step("Solve Each Part") {
      text`Let's solve each part of the problem step by step.`;
    }
    step("Combine Solutions") {
      text`Finally, let's combine our solutions to solve the original problem.`;
    }
  }
}
```

## Few-Shot Learning

Few-Shot Learning provides the LLM with a few examples of the task, allowing it to understand the pattern and apply it to new instances.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  fewShot {
    example {
      input: text`Translate "Hello" to French`;
      output: text`"Hello" in French is "Bonjour"`;
    }
    example {
      input: text`Translate "Goodbye" to French`;
      output: text`"Goodbye" in French is "Au revoir"`;
    }
  }
}
```

## Zero-Shot Learning

Zero-Shot Learning attempts to solve a task without any specific examples, relying on the model's general knowledge and the task description.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  zeroShot {
    instruction: "Classify the following text into one of these categories: Sports, Politics, Technology, or Entertainment.";
  }
}
```

## Self-Consistency

Self-Consistency generates multiple solutions to a problem and then selects the most consistent or frequent answer, improving reliability.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  selfConsistency {
    generations: 5;
    selectionStrategy: "majority_vote";
  }
}
```

## Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

Tree of Thoughts expands on Chain of Thought by exploring multiple reasoning paths and evaluating them to find the best solution.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  treeOfThoughts {
    breadth: 3;
    depth: 2;
    evaluationStrategy: "highest_probability";
  }
}
```

## Active Prompting

Active Prompting uses uncertainty-based active learning to adapt LLMs to different tasks by selecting the most informative examples for annotation.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  activePrompting {
    uncertaintyEstimation: "entropy";
    selectionStrategy: "max_uncertainty";
    annotationProcess: "human_in_the_loop";
  }
}
```

## Reason and Act (ReAct)

ReAct combines reasoning and acting, allowing the LLM to interact with its environment and make decisions based on observations.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  reAct {
    observation: {
      text`Observe the current state of the environment.`;
    }
    thought: {
      text`Based on the observation, what should we do next?`;
    }
    action: {
      text`Perform the chosen action and observe its effects.`;
    }
  }
}
```

## Reasoning WithOut Observation (ReWOO)

ReWOO separates the reasoning process from external observations, potentially improving efficiency and generalization.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  reWOO {
    planner: {
      text`Develop a high-level plan to solve the problem.`;
    }
    worker: {
      text`Execute each step of the plan, gathering necessary information.`;
    }
    solver: {
      text`Use the gathered information to solve the original problem.`;
    }
  }
}
```

## Reflection

Reflection allows the LLM to analyze its own performance and adjust its approach accordingly.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  reflection {
    reflectionPrompt: "Analyze your previous response. What could be improved?";
    memoryBuffer: "previous_responses";
  }
}
```

## Expert Prompting

Expert Prompting instructs the LLM to assume the role of a specific type of expert, potentially improving performance on domain-specific tasks.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  expertPrompting {
    expertIdentity: "World-renowned Physicist";
    expertDescription: text`You are a leading expert in quantum mechanics with decades of research experience.`;
  }
}
```

## Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE)

APE uses the LLM itself to generate and optimize prompts, potentially finding more effective formulations.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  ape {
    candidatePool: 10;
    scoreFunction: "accuracy_on_validation_set";
  }
}
```

## Auto-CoT

Auto-CoT automatically generates Chain of Thought examples by clustering questions and selecting representative samples.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  autoCoT {
    clusteringMethod: "k-means";
    representativeSelection: "cluster_centroid";
  }
}
```

## Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART)

ART combines reasoning with the use of external tools, allowing the LLM to solve complex problems that require additional capabilities.

### Example:

```nudgelang
technique {
  art {
    taskLibrary: "common_reasoning_tasks";
    toolLibrary: "math_and_logic_tools";
    decompositionStrategy: "recursive_task_decomposition";
  }
}
```

## Combining Techniques

NudgeLang allows you to combine multiple techniques to create sophisticated prompting strategies. Here's an example that combines Chain of Thought with Expert Prompting:

```nudgelang
technique {
  expertPrompting {
    expertIdentity: "Master Chess Player";
    expertDescription: text`You are a chess grandmaster with decades of experience in high-level tournament play.`;
  }
  chainOfThought {
    step("Analyze the Position") {
      text`First, let's evaluate the current board position.`;
    }
    step("Consider Possible Moves") {
      text`Now, let's list and analyze potential moves.`;
    }
    step("Evaluate Consequences") {
      text`For each move, let's consider its short-term and long-term consequences.`;
    }
    step("Make a Decision") {
      text`Based on our analysis, let's choose the best move and explain why.`;
    }
  }
}
```

By leveraging these advanced techniques, you can create more powerful and effective prompts tailored to specific tasks and domains. Experiment with different combinations to find what works best for your use case.
